-- tDiary BlogKit: How to run tDiary like blog. --

What's BlogKit?
---------------
tDiary BlogKit modifies tDiary. This modification enables 
tDiary to manage articles by topics, not daily.
tDiary with BlogKit is different from original one:

- Date has no meaning. It looks like 'serial number'.
- Each topic have last-modified.
- Top page has the 1st section of each topic(like summary).
- tDiary with BlogKit makes new topic number automatically when update.
- BlogKit adds new features: 'Recent Entries' and 'What's New'.

You can setup BlogKit without changing tDiary. It is only plugged-in.

how to install
--------------

You must use tDiary version 2.1.3 or later.
Here, it is assumed that you install tDiary under $INSTALL anew. 

1. Creating tdiary.conf

  And, rewrite @data_path in the tdiary.conf to your data saving
  directory. Read README of tDiary about @data_path. 

2. Copy blog_style.rb

  original and copy tdiary/blogwiki_style.rb into $INSTALL/tdiary.
  And specify "@style = 'BlogWiki'" in your tdiary.conf.

  original and copy tdiary/blogrd_style.rb into $INSTALL/tdiary.
